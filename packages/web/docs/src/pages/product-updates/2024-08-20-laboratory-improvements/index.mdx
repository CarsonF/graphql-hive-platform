In recent months I have worked on improving the Hive's laboratory, its new look and its new
features. And here is what was improved.

## Operations Collections Plugin

### New Look

Hive's Operations collections plugin received a new look to make consistency with Hive UI, GraphiQL
toolbars buttons "Copy Query" and "Merge fragments into query" were removed, "Prettify query" button
was moved to the end of the toolbar.

### Full Screen Mode

Users with wide screens can now benefit from the fullscreen mode. The button is located in place of
GraphiQL logo.

### Tabs Support

Laboratory now supports multiple tabs, you can open multiple tabs with different queries and switch
between them as in regular GraphiQL. There is no longer requirement to mandatory save the query in
one of the collections, you can have a draft query which will be stored in local storage.

The differences Hive's tabs from regular GraphiQL tabs is better look, I inspired by UX and UI of
Google Chrome tabs, and we loved new look so much, so we decided
[to change them in next major of GraphiQL as well](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3644).

Also,
[tabs will be shown even if there is only a single tab](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3713)
as per Chrome tabs UX.

And for comparison, below is how GraphiQL tabs look like now:
