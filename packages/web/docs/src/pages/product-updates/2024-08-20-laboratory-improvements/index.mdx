In recent months I have worked on improving the Hive's laboratory, its new look and its new
features. And here is what was improved.

## Operations Collections Plugin

### New Look

Hive's Operations collections plugin received a new look to make consistency with Hive UI, GraphiQL
toolbars buttons "Copy Query" and "Merge fragments into query" were removed, "Prettify query" button
was moved to the end of the toolbar.

### Full Screen Mode

Users with wide screens can now benefit from the fullscreen mode. The button is located in place of
GraphiQL logo.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Tabs Support

Laboratory now supports multiple tabs, you can open multiple tabs with different queries and switch
between them as in regular GraphiQL. There is no longer requirement to mandatory save the query in
one of the collections, you can have a draft query which will be stored in local storage.

## GraphiQL v4 Alpha
